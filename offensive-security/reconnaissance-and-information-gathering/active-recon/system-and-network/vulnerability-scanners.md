# Vulnerability Scanners

Vulnerability scanning is a critical component of active reconnaissance. It involves the automated detection of vulnerabilities within a network or system. These tools assess computers, networks, and applications for known weaknesses, scanning for security holes that could be exploited by attackers. The goal is to identify and patch these vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. Here's a detailed look at 20 vulnerability scanning tools:
