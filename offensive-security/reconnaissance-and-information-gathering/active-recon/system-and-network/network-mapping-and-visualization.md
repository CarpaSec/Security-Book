# Network Mapping and Visualization

In active reconnaissance, Network Mapping and Visualization involve creating a visual representation of the network's structure, including devices, connections, and topology. This process helps in identifying key nodes, network boundaries, and potential areas of vulnerability. OS Fingerprinting and Service Identification are crucial components of this process. They involve determining the operating system and services running on each networked device, which helps in identifying vulnerabilities specific to those systems or services.
