# Domain Enumeration

## Domains

A domain, in the context of networking and cybersecurity, is an area of the internet that's controlled by a specific entity or organization. It's most commonly understood as the part of a website's URL that identifies it uniquely on the web. For instance, in the URL "[www.example.com](http://www.example.com)," "example.com" is the domain. Domains are organized in a hierarchical structure with top-level domains (TLDs) like ".com", ".org", ".net", etc., at the top, followed by second-level domains (like "example" in "example.com"), and potentially further subdivisions.

Domains are essential for the functioning of the internet, providing human-readable addresses for websites and services. They play a crucial role in cybersecurity, as understanding and managing the domain landscape of an organization is key to securing its digital presence and assets.
